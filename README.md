# Nails Skeleton App

This is a skeleton app for Nails, the absolute basics for a Nails application. To do
anything exciting with this skeleton, you'll need the latest Nails dependencies.

The Nails [command line tool](https://github.com/nailsapp/command-line-tool) is a
nifty little gadget to make dealing with your Nails apps a total breeze. If you
haven't already, install it like so:

	brew tap nailsapp/nailsapp
	brew install nails

Next, change to this app's directory and run the Nails installer; then it's simply
a case of following the on screen instructions:

	cd /path/to/app
	nails install

**Note:** Now that you have the Nails Command line utility, you can start a new Nails
app simply issuing `nails new app-name` in your parent directory of choice.
